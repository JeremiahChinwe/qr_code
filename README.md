## My process

I first viewed the design carefully then wrote the html code for the markup/scetch work. Then I styled it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Building this project, I learned that when using Flexbox, you can minimize writing lines of media query by using the flex-wrap property which helps wraps the content of your pages according to the width of the device.

```css
.wrap {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

### Continued development

The area of web developement I want to keep focusing on even in subsequent projects is CSS. I want to master styling web pages with CSS properties that are compatible with all browsers.
